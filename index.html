                    <strong style="color: brown;">Pulp Fiction</strong> is a
                    1994 American independent
                    crime film written and directed by
                    <a
                        href="./second-page.html">Quentin
                        Tarantino</a>
                    from a story he conceived with
                    Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and
                    violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John
                    Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving
                    Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp
                    magazines
                    and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th
                    century,
                    known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.

                    Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating
                    scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993).
                    Its
                    plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also
                    self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a
                    title card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp".
                    Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual
                    conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each
                    character's
                    perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an
                    ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar
                    Pictures reportedly turned down the script as
                    "too demented".
                    Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled,
                    however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films
                    fully
                    financed.

                <p>
                    <em>Pulp Fiction's</em> narrative is told out of
                    chronological
                    order and
                    follows three main interrelated stories that each have a
                    different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch
                    Coolidge, a
                    prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's business
                    partner.

                    The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple,
                    then
                    begins to shift from one story line to another before
                    returning
                    to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative
                    sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by
                    intertitles:
