                        born March 27, 1963
                        is an American filmmaker and actor. His films are
                        characterized
                        by stylized violence, extended dialogue often with
                        profanity,
                        and references to popular culture. Tarantino's work has
                        been
                        subject to criticism, such as the depictions of violence
                        and
                        frequent inclusion of racial slurs. During Tarantino's
                        career,
                        his films have garnered a cult following, as well as
                        critical
                        and commercial success; he has been considered
                        "the single most influential director of his generation".
                        He is
                        the recipient of two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards,
                        and four
                        Golden Globe Awards.

                        Tarantino began his career as an independent filmmaker
                        with the
                        release of the neo-noir crime drama film Reservoir Dogs
                        in 1992.
                        His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a dark comedy
                        crime
                        thriller, was a major success with critics and audiences
                        winning
                        numerous awards, including the Cannes Film Festival's
                        Palme d'Or
                        and the Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, he wrote and
                        starred
                        in the action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn.
                        Tarantino's third
                        film, the crime drama Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage
                        to
                        blaxploitation films.

                        In 2003, Tarantino directed Kill Bill: Volume 1,
                        inspired by the
                        traditions of martial arts films; it was followed by
                        Volume 2 in
                        2004, with both volumes combined regarded as a single
                        film.
                        He then made the exploitation-slasher Death Proof
                        (2007),
                        part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez released
                        under the
                        collective title Grindhouse. His next film, Inglourious
                        Basterds
                        (2009), follows an alternate account of World War II. He
                        followed this with Django Unchained (2012), a slave
                        revenge
                        Spaghetti Western, which won him his second Academy
                        Award for
                        Best Original Screenplay. His eighth film, The Hateful
                        Eight
                        (2015), is a revisionist Western thriller and opened to
                        audiences with a roadshow release. His most recent film,
                        Once
                        Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), is a comedy drama set
                        in the
                        late 1960s about the transition of Old Hollywood to New
                        Hollywood. A novelization of the film written by
                        Tarantino was
                        published in 2021, becoming his debut novel.
